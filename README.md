# Cable-Bacteria-MAGs

**Description:**
Repository for scripts and resources used for recovery of cable bacteria MAGs from sequenced samples. <br/>
The project was performed in collaboration with researchers from the [Center for Electromicrobiology](https://bio.au.dk/forskning/forskningscentre/center-for-elektromikrobiologi-cem/) and is part of [Microflora Danica](https://vbn.aau.dk/da/projects/the-microbiome-of-denmark).

**Quick links:**
* Paper featuring the recovered cable bacteria MAGs can be accessed [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-023-01372-6).
* Sequencing read datasets and the recovered high-quality/medium-quality MAGs are available at [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB52550).
* The first-ever closed genome of a cable bacteria (*Candidatus* Electronema aureum GS) is available at [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/fasta/GCA_942492785.1?download=true&gzip=true).
* The first-ever closed genome of a novel cable bacteria species capable of survival in a saline environement (*Candidatus* Electronema halotolerans) is available at [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/fasta/GCA_942493095.1?download=true&gzip=false).
