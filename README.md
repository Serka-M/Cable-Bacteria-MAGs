# Cable-Bacteria-MAGs

**Description:**
Repository for scripts and resources used for recovery of cable bacteria MAGs from sequenced samples. <br/>
The project was performed in collaboration with researchers from the [Center for Electromicrobiology](https://bio.au.dk/forskning/forskningscentre/center-for-elektromikrobiologi-cem/) and is part of [Microflora Danica](https://www.en.engineering.aau.dk/Cases/Microflora-Danica/).

**Quick links:**
* Pre-print featuring the recovered cable bacteria MAGs can be accessed [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.26.513921v1).
* Sequencing read datasets and the recovered high-quality/medium-quality MAGs are available at [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB52550).
* The first-ever closed genome of a cable bacteria (*Candidatus* Electronema aureum GS) is available at [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/report/analysisFiles/ERZ9795947).
* The first-ever closed genome of a novel cable bacteria species capable of survival in a saline environement (*Candidatus* Electronema halotolerans) is available at [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/report/analysisFiles/ERZ9795966).
